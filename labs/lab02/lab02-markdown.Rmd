## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by 
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) and Aaron Swartz allowing people 
"to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert 
it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".

### Markdown Tutorial

Work on this [Interactive online markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)


### More practice

If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can try using one of the several 
online Markdown editors and parsers such as:

- [markdown live preview](http://markdownlivepreview.com/)
- [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor)
- [dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)

These are nice tools that will allow you to practice the syntax, while 
getting an idea of how the output may look like. 
There are also markdown editors that you can download:

- All users: [haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html#download)
- Mac users: [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
- Windows users: [Markdownpad](http://markdownpad.com/)

## Pandoc

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a unviersal document converter. It allows you
to convert files from one markup format into another.

- Create a new directory `stat159-markdown`, and `cd` into it.
- Create a text file, e.g. `document.md`, 
- Include all the content from your text in [http://markdownlivepreview.com](http://markdownlivepreview.com) in your new file `document.md`.


### Convert your document into html

To convert your document into html, you will have to use __pandoc__.
From the command line, type:

```bash
# from markdown to html
pandoc -s document.md -o document.html
```

Try converting your markdown file to pdf (you need to have latex installed!):

```bash
# from markdown to pdf
pandoc document.md --latex-engine=xelatex -o document.pdf

# alternatively
pandoc document.md --latex-engine=pdflatex -o document.pdf
```
